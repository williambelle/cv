[**Awesome CV**](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) is LaTeX template for
a **CV(Curriculum Vitae)**, **Résumé** or **Cover Letter** inspired by [Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv). It is easy to
customize your own template, especially since it is really written by a clean,
semantic markup.
